# Bee Search handoff

## Current milestone

Safe physical object deletion, monotonic numbering and an explicit numbering
reset are implemented over the approved Objects UI and accepted by the owner,
who also verified them manually on the phone.

Last functional commit: `50c75b2e` `feat: add safe physical object deletion and
numbering reset`. This handoff refresh is the only commit after it.

What is in place:

- Objects V1 UI is implemented: `+ -> Дупло / Колода`, crosshair coordinates,
  live/manual azimuth, media, saved-object cards, characteristic editing and
  coordinate correction.
- The browser hierarchy is corrected: `Объекты` shows the categories
  `Ареал`, `Точки наблюдения`, `Дупла`, `Колоды`; a row is `Дупло N` / `Колода N`
  without repeating the type; Back goes card -> its list -> `Объекты`.
- `карточка -> Показать на карте -> Back` returns to the same card, and an
  ordinary map opening never inherits that return target.
- An unused Hollow or LogHive can be deleted from its card after confirmation
  (`Удалить объект`); the object, its subtype row, its media rows and its
  app-owned media files are removed, and the deletion returns to the typed list.
- Deleting a protected object is blocked: a `Bee -> object` reference (and any
  future `Inspection` reference) refuses the deletion with a readable message
  and keeps the card open.
- Persistent numbering high-water mark (`physical_object_sequences`, scope
  `Territory + object_type`) is allocated inside the create transaction as
  `max(last_issued, live MAX) + 1`; a failed creation consumes no number.
- Ordinary deletion never frees a number: deleting `Дупло 4` still gives the
  next created object `Дупло 5`.
- An explicit, fail-closed reset restarts one scope from 1, only while that
  scope provably holds no objects, no dependent rows and no references; it is
  offered in the empty typed list and re-checked in the repository. The stable
  UUID remains the object identity: a repeated designation is a new object.
- Room schema v10 (`MIGRATION_9_10` backfills `last_issued = MAX(sequence_number)`).
- Complete Backup V5 carries `physical-object-sequences`; the reader still
  accepts V1-V4 and bootstraps those from stored numbers.
- D090 (ACCEPTED) records the semantics; D088 §2/§3/§4 were updated consistently
  and D088 §14's open question is closed. Next free durable decision: D091.
- The RESTRICT invariant has an automatic test: `PhysicalObjectReferenceRestrictTest`
  reads the foreign keys of the live database and fails if any reference to
  `physical_objects` is not `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.

## Verification status

JVM unit suite `390 tests / 0 failures`; `assembleDebug` and
`assembleDebugAndroidTest` pass; `lintDebug` passes with no new findings;
`git diff --check` clean.

Preserving Samsung SM-S938B instrumentation: the full connected suite reports
`386 tests, 12 skipped, 0 failed`, and a focused run of the numbering, deletion,
media, RESTRICT, backup, migration, browser and reset classes reports
`105/105 PASS`. Device walk on `org.beesearch.app.dev` covered create -> delete
(confirmation, return to `Дупла`, absence after restart), no reuse of the
deleted number, LogHive deletion with its own confirmation text, and a reset in
a disposable Territory (counter 2 -> next object `Дупло 1`) that was then
removed again. Pre-existing DEV objects were preserved
(`ceDataInode=438163`, `deDataInode=424656` unchanged); DEV was updated in
place without clearing data.

The owner additionally checked deletion, number non-reuse and the explicit
reset manually on the phone and confirmed that the behaviour matches the intent.

## Unverified / known residue (no action required for the accepted feature)

- Media deletion was not exercised through the real camera / system picker UI;
  file ownership and cleanup are covered by device instrumentation instead.
- Deleting a protected object was not exercised through real Bee-history UI; the
  blocking path is covered by repository, integration and schema tests.
- The new delete/reset UI was not separately inspected at a large system font
  scale (it is text-button based and the system scale was left untouched).
- A restore rollback warning does not exist: the application has no restore
  flow at all (only export), so there is nowhere to compare the current and the
  incoming numbering state. Restore semantics are documented in D090.

## Next task

No active functional task for Physical Objects. Beta `1.3.0-beta.3` stays the
current test build until a separate release decision; no push, Beta/Stable
release or version change was made. Continue from commit `50c75b2e` on `main`.

## Previous milestone

The approved `objects-ui-approved-v1` redesign was implemented over the Objects
V1 foundation: compact directly editable azimuth with the production
`HeadingProvider`, visual media thumbnails, adaptive control stacking, saved
cards with hero preview, characteristics and provenance, and coordinate
correction through one narrow repository/DAO update that changes only
latitude/longitude for Hollow and LogHive. Room was v9 and Complete Backup v4 at
that point; both were superseded by the current milestone.
